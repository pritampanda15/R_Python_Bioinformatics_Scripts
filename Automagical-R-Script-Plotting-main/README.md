# Automagical-R-Script-Plotting
1. This script automatically creates a bunch of relevant plots based on the type of data you enter <br>
2. First it automatically detects your file's delimiter (tab or comma) and whether it has a header <br>
3. Then it categorizes each column by the type of data contained in the column <br>
4. And finally it makes a bunch of plots fitting each column and combinations of different columns<br>
